First test using GitHub, making a site theme for Gers.nl
This ia the first time I use and test GitHub, I want to make a webiste theme (and afterwards also for WordPress).

**Programs;**
Just use a text editor or Visual Studio Code bij Microsoft (https://code.visualstudio.com/),
Scripting used: HTML / SCC

**Function;**
Make a site theme....
Later also a WordPress version out of this theme ;)

**How to use;**
... for now this is a private project, maybe later I will contribute it for WordPress.

**How to contribute;**
For now (I think) I don't need any help :)
