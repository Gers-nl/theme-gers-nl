**Title**
First test using GitHub, making a site theme for Gers.nl
This is the first time I use and test GitHub, I want to make a webiste theme (and afterwards also for WordPress compatible).

**Programs**
I've just used a text editor or Visual Studio Code bij Microsoft (https://code.visualstudio.com/), a internet browser for previewing and somed scripting (HTML and CSS).

**Function**
Make a site theme.... later also for WordPress (at least that is my goal).

**How to use**
... for now this is a private project, and not ready, so you can't use it yet. Maybe later I will contribute it for WordPress.

**How to contribute**
For now (I think) I don't need any help :)
